# requestsPrimitiveSample 

This is a sample of an HTTP session with the Requests library
Its intended use is to demonstrate an authenticated session with a REST API 

I use this in an environment configured like this: 

1. Pyenv w/ Python >= 3.10
2. Requests library installed via pip 
3. Certifi library installed via pip 
4. ``CERT_PATH=`python -m certifi` ``
4. edit ``$CERT_PATH`` to append local CA certificate 
5. ``export SSL_CERT_FILE={$CERT_PATH}``
6. ``export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=${CERT_PATH}``

I will also typically install iPython to allow interactive queries of the API.
